# About

This knowledge base is intended to reduce the barrier to entering the field
of molecular programming.

It should quickly give readers the up-to-date information they need
to perform research, use and create tools, design and fabricate new devices, and
collaborate with the rest of the molecular programming community.

# What is Molecular Programming?

Through its ability to control matter at the atomic level, molecular programming enables
the creation of entirely new technologies. It will impact many industries, and radically
transform society.

## Transforming Society
- **Democratization of Technology**: As molecular programming tools become more accessible,
they could empower individuals and small organizations to create and manipulate materials
on their own, bypassing the need for large-scale industrial facilities. This could lead
to a more distributed, open-source approach to technological innovation, where anyone with
the right knowledge and resources could contribute to the creation of new materials,
devices, and systems.
   
- **New Economic Models**: The ability to program matter and self-organize complex systems
could lead to new business models, including decentralized manufacturing, personalized
products, and entirely new industries based on molecular-scale systems. As the cost of
manufacturing advanced materials decreases, we may see a shift toward more sustainable,
locally produced goods.
   
- **Ethical and Societal Considerations**: With the power to engineer molecules, there comes
a responsibility to consider the ethical implications. The ability to design life-like systems,
whether for therapeutic use or for creating artificial life, raises profound questions about
the boundaries between biology and technology, the potential for unintended consequences, and
the regulation of these powerful technologies. Society will need to grapple with these issues
as molecular programming becomes a mainstream technology.
